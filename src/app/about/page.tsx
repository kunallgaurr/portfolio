                    Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span className="text-white font-medium">Kunal Gaur</span>, and if I had to sum up my story in one line â€” I started with curiosity and stayed because of passion.

                <SectionHeading title="Where It All Began" />
                <Paragraph>
                    My journey into the world of programming started the way it does for many developers â€” with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It felt magical that a few lines of code could turn into a
                    working webpage. Iâ€™d spend hours tweaking layouts, playing with hover effects, and breaking things just to fix them again. That curiosity slowly became a habit.

                <Paragraph>
                    Soon, I started to wonder â€” what happens after I click a button? Where does the data go? How does it come back? That question pulled me toward backend development.

                <Paragraph>
                    I began exploring Node.js and MongoDB. Suddenly, everything felt deeper â€” it wasnâ€™t just about the UI anymore; it was about logic, structure, and data flow. During this phase, I
                    built small projects, culminating in a social media website that became a turning point for me. Seeing it work â€” with real-time updates, authentication, and posts â€” was pure joy.

                <SectionHeading title="The Internship â€” My First Real Step" />
                <Paragraph>
                    My first professional opportunity came at <span className="text-white font-medium">Simplyfi</span>, where I worked on two main products â€” a Chatbot App and Asset Fractio, a
                    platform for asset tokenization. It was my first real taste of working on live systems, handling production data, and building scalable backends.

                <Paragraph>The internship became my launchpad â€” after months of learning and contributing, I received a full-time offer.</Paragraph>

                <SectionHeading title="Growing as a Professional" />
                <Paragraph>
                    As a Full-Time Node.js Developer at Simplyfi, I deepened my knowledge of Express.js and integrated Redis for performance improvements. I learned how to collaborate with teams,
                    manage features end-to-end, and write maintainable code. My work with Prisma, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL helped me strengthen my backend foundation.

                <Paragraph>
                    After mastering NoSQL, I explored SQL â€” understanding relationships, joins, and transactions opened new doors for data handling. This phase led me to{" "}
                    <span className="text-white font-medium">Deltatech Gaming</span>, where I entered the world of high-performance, event-driven systems.

                <SectionHeading title="The Deltatech Chapter" />
                <Paragraph>
                    At Deltatech Gaming, I worked with Redis, RabbitMQ, and microservices to build reliable and scalable systems. It was both challenging and rewarding â€” I learned how distributed
                    systems communicate, handle failures, and stay performant at scale. This experience refined my system design and architectural thinking.
